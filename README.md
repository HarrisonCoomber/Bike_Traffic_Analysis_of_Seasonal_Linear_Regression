 An Example of Linear Regression using hourly bike traffic data.

 This Notebook extends work done in a University module from the University of Exeter (MTHM503 Applications of Data Science and Statistics) taught by Stefan Siegert (S.Siegert@exeter.ac.uk). The analysis itself in this notebook is inspired by the analysis in chapter 5.6 in the Python Data Science Handbook. (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/)
